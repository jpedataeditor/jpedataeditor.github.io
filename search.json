We encourage you nevertheless to try and impose a rigid folder structure on your research project from day one, when concerns about a replication package might still be far away - some folder could even remain empty for a while, but that’s ok! You will save a lot of time later on. Here are two examples:\n\n\n\n\nGood.\n\nMeaningful sub directories\ntop level README\ncode/data/output are separated\n\n.\n├── README.md\n├── code\n│   ├── R\n│   │   ├── 0-install.R\n│   │   ├── 1-main.R\n│   │   ├── 2-figure2.R\n│   │   └── 3-table2.R\n│   ├── stata\n│   │   ├── 1-main.do\n│   │   ├── 2-read_raw.do\n│   │   ├── 3-figure1.do\n│   │   ├── 4-figure2.do\n│   │   └── 5-table1.do\n│   └── tex\n│       ├── appendix.tex\n│       └── main.tex\n├── data\n│   ├── processed\n│   └── raw\n└── output\n    ├── plots\n    └── tables\nNotice how this example includes tex/main.tex which will produce the final product. The code folder would contain all the source code needed to produce everything in the paper, and could be placed under version control. Notice also that the content of output/ could be erased without problems - all required inputs are separated and could regenerate all results immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot So Good.\n\nSub directories are not helpful\nFile names are confusing\nno README\ncode/data/output are not separated\n\n.\n├── 20211107ext_2v1.do\n├── 20220120ext_2v1.do\n├── 20221101wave1.dta\n├── james\n│   └── NLSY97\n│       └── nlsy97_v2.do\n├── mary\n│   └── NLSY97\n│       └── nlsy97.do\n├── matlab_fortran\n│   ├── graphs\n│   ├── sensitivity1\n│   │   ├── data.xlsx\n│   │   ├── good_version.do\n│   │   └── script.m\n│   └── sensitivity2\n│       ├── models.f90\n│       ├── models.mod\n│       └── nrtype.f90\n├── readme.do\n├── scatter1.eps\n├── scatter1_1.eps\n├── scatter1_2.eps\n├── ts.eps\n├── wave1.dta\n└── wave2.dta\n└── wave2regs.dta\n└── wave2regs2.dta"

Click here for a tutorial.\nUse programs/scripts as opposed to command-line instructions!\nDesign your code to be run all at once, and not section by section. Create a master file that calls all other subsidiary files.\nSet the paths only once and at the top of the master-file, and then use either relative paths or global variables, so that users don’t have to change the paths in multiple parts of your code.\nWhenever possible, write paths in a way that is compatible across different operating systems. For example, in Stata, always use forward slashes / to separate directories, even if you use Windows.\nIf you are using software which requires compilation of source code into executables (e.g. Fortran, C, etc.), please use make files (or else make sure you provide very detailed instructions on how to compile the different files - we accept bash shell scripts).\nName your files in a wise manner. For example, if your output generates tables and figures as new files, give them names that easily identify them. Also, name your master file as “Main”, “Master” or something similar.\nUse sub-folders when your package includes a lot of files. Make sure that your package includes all relevant folders, even empty folders that will be filled with the outputs from the program."

You can find a set of Frequently Asked Questions about the situations under which you can or cannot apply to an exemption to the data and code availability policy here.\nIf you want to request a Data Exemption, you need to select the second option for the Data Policy box during your submission process at the Editorial Express platform, as illustrated in figure Figure 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Data Policy Exemption\n\n\n\nAdditionally, attach a Cover Letter along with your paper in which you indicate the reasons why you believe you are entitled to an exemption to our data and code availability policy.\nOnce the paper is submitted, the Managing Editor will analyze whether (i) there are enough grounds to grant the exemption and (ii) the exemption or the nature of the data limits the interest of the paper. Based on her assessment of these two points, she will make one of the following decisions: (a) move forward with the process, sending your paper to referees, (b) summarily reject your paper, or (c) contact you asking to provide additional information, documentation, or any other requirement that she needs to assess the suitability of the requested exemption. The exemptions are tacitly granted by choosing option (a).\nOnce your paper is conditionally accepted, you will be requested to supply your replication package according to the guidelines specified here on this website. If an exemption to the Data and Code Availability Policy was granted, you will be requested to either provide the Data Editor (and, by extension, to the team of replicators) with temporary access to the data affected by the exemption for the sole purpose of implementing the reproducibility checks. Alternatively, when granting temporary access to the restricted data is not possible, you will be required to include in your package a synthetic or simulated dataset that allows users to run the code and check that it produces all outputs from the paper (and appendices), even if the results do not match those in the paper.

In the current post, we will see inconsistent results for built-in STATA commands across versions, in a future post I plan to illlustrate problematic interactions with user-contributed code in the form of so-called .ado files (I will refer to those as packages). We will draw on real-world examples in the form of replication packages published together with academic papers in the Economic Journal. We will perform computational experiments by running identical code and data with different versions of STATA.\nThe starting point of this exploration is a blog post by the president of StataCorp from 2019 (with a similar message on the STATA website):\nWe will encounter below one example where we found behaviour which is incompatible with this statement. The aim of this post is not to discredit STATA in any way, but to provide hopefully useful advice on how to avoid distributing unreproducible code. In general, there is nothing which would make STATA better or worse suited to achieve reproducibility, and in this sense I humbly disagree with the above statement. Each language presents its own set of challenges, and being aware of those goes a long way. We reserve a comparison of computing languages in terms of being helpful to writing reproducible code for another occasion."

The fact that this works is on the one hand nothing but remarkable - the code base of STATA must have changed considerably over the last few decades, surely countless bugs must have been fixed, etc, therefore ensuring that this works must require tremendous effort; on the other hand, it is obvious that version x does not replace the currently running STATA binary with the one of previous STATA version x, so any interactions of that binary with the current computing environment (OS, support libraries etc) could lead to unexpected behaviour. Indeed, we will document such behaviour below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Editors do not care about backward compatibility\n\n\n\nIn general, Data Editors would not require that your code needs to be reproducible with all versions of STATA; quite on the contrary, we want a very specific description of the required environment. Another aim of this post is thus to clarify some (unexpected) effects of the version command, and to counter the belief that setting version will guarantee cross version reproducibility."

We are also agnostic about whether the authors were writing code in any way incompatible with STATA version 18, because:\nTo us, this is irrelevant, as we want to be able to rely on the promise embedded in version 16 solving all issues. The authors set version 16, as well as all required random seeds, in the correct fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🏆 Data Editor Award for Excellent Collaboration\n\n\n\nThe Burchardi et al package features high quality of code and exceptional collaboration on behalf of the authors. All results replicate exactly on STATA version 16, as indicated in their package readme. They were the first to point out the issue with xporegress to me. Thanks to them! 🤝\n\n\n\nStep 1: Safe Environment via docker\n\nWe want to minimize the risk that anything in our findings is driven by my local STATA installation, and its interaction with my OS. A good solution to this is a containerized environment, for example via docker.\nWe want to have 2 docker containers with version 16 and 18 respectively. We basically want to test the effect of the version 16 command on the stata 18 binary.\nThe dedicated repository of docker images provided by the AEA Data Editor Lars Vilhuber is going to be very helpful here. The prebuilt docker images for different stata versions are available here on dockerhub.\n\nWe can run STATA 16 and STATA 18 as if we had two separate machines inside an isolated environment (a container) on our own computer.\nNotice that there are no user contributed packages installed into those containers. Furthermore, Burchardi et al provide .ado files for add-on packages with their code. So, we have a clean slate.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Code to Run Experiment\nTo minimize further mistakes from manually handling code and results, I wrote some julia code which is available here. It downloads the Burchardi et al package from zenodo.org, unpacks it, modifies it slightly (so that it only produces the required appendix table B8 where the discrepancy arises), and then launches the respective STATA containers with the identical code and data; first version 16, where results correspond exactly to the paper, and then version 18, where they do not. The point being, given the promise contained in the version 16 command, results should correspond across versions.\nIf you follow instructions contained therein, you will see the following output in your terminal:\nfloswald@PTL11077 ~/g/E/b/stataversion (main)&gt; julia --project=. runblog.jl\n\n[ Info: downloading record Burchardi\n[ Info: content of /Users/floswald/git/EJData/blogs/stataversion/Burchardi/3-replication-package\n[\".DS_Store\", \"Code\", \"Data\", \"Materials\", \"Output\", \"README.pdf\"]\n[ Info: done downloading\n[ Info: run with stata 16\n[ Info: STATA version 16, docker IMG tag 2023-06-13\nWARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested\n[ Info: renaming /Users/floswald/git/EJData/blogs/stataversion/Burchardi/3-replication-package/Output/Tables/DEMED_AppendixTableB8_dummy.tex\n[ Info: renaming /Users/floswald/git/EJData/blogs/stataversion/Burchardi/3-replication-package/Output/Tables/DEMED_AppendixTableB8_index.tex\n[\"/Users/floswald/git/EJData/blogs/stataversion/Burchardi/3-replication-package/Output/Tables/DEMED_AppendixTableB8_dummy-v16.tex\", \"/Users/floswald/git/EJData/blogs/stataversion/Burchardi/3-replication-package/Output/Tables/DEMED_AppendixTableB8_index-v16.tex\"]\n[ Info: run with stata 18\n[ Info: STATA version 18, docker IMG tag 2024-04-30\nWARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested\n[ Info: done 👋\n\n\nStep 3: Results\nThe code repository also contains a short latex script which will compile the tables outputted from each docker container into a simple table. We can compare the result for each table across both versions. We can see for 2 columns a noticeable difference, both in estimates as well as in standard errors. The numbers in equally colored shapes should be identical.\n\n\n\nResults for Table B8 Panel A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults for Table B8 Panel B"

However, the heights of the bars are hard coded as numbers. If it is not obvious where the numbers come from, then this fact should be a prominent feature in your report.\n\n\n\nhard coded numbers in code for a plot (python)\n\n\n\n\nHow to find hard coded numbers?\nRegular expressions (Regex) are the perfect tool for this.

Now you can enter regex search terms. Here, I’m entering \\d for digits (i.e. numbers), and I’m saying {3,10} to instruct the search to look for sequences of numbers with length in between 3 and 10. That is, numbers ranging from 3 up to 10 digits. You can change that of course. Notice how the search returns immediately all occurences of such numbers in the project.\n\n\n\nusing regex search to look for numbers between 3 and 10 digits long. plots.jl seems to contain hard coded numbers as source code.\n\n\nFinally, look whether any of those numbers do appear in a code file. Here, the plots.jl seems to be suspicious. Double click on a particular search results opens the relevant source file. Gotcha!\n\n\n\nExample of hard coded numbers to generate a plot.

I strongly recommend the conda distribution - please follow instructions to install. This is what is available on nuvolos (i.e. nothing to do for python on nuvolos, it’s there.)\n\n\nNext, on to our case study. An author says:\n\nWe use python. You must install the networkx package from pip. The rest of the packages is standard.\n\nThis is an incomplete specification on various counts.\n\nWe must know which python version to use. There are many.\nWe cannot work with the rest of the packages is standard. There is no notion of standard in this setting.\nInstalling via pip for instance depends on which particular python version is installed, and how that particular version of networkx relates to those standard packages mentioned above.\n\n👉 It is highly likely that following those instructions, we end up with a vastly different set of package (and base python!) versions than what the authors used on their machine.\n👉 Not good, because this alone could lead to diverging results and/or errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Virtual Environments\n\n\n\nEasiest with anaconda on nuvolos or your own machine, but base python also has a solution.\n\nconda solution\nbase python solution\n\nI recommend the conda route.\n\n\nLet’s solve this particular case. We will create a virtual environment for ourselves, making some assumptions along the way. We can at least communicate with the authors on that assumed basis. Therefore, we open VScode and look at the notebook file (notice this is much quicker than opening a jupyterlab session). We note that in the first code box they import the required libraries. We want to have an environment containing those packages.\n\n\n\nOpening a jupyter notebook in VSCode to see package dependencies\n\n\nThere are two ways to create an environment: on the command line or by writing a .yml file.\n\nCreating a conda env on the command line\nThis is easy.\n\nOpen a terminal in VScode via the command palette (type shift-cmd-p or click cogwheel bottom left). In the command palette type create new terminal and hit enter.\nIn the terminal window create the new environment, maybe called with the author’s name, specifying all required versions, as well as an assumed python version:\n# creates new virtual env called `author-name`\n# notice that the nuvolos terminal runs conda by default and tells\n# you that your are in the (base) environment now:\n(base) 11:35:56 - nuvolos:/files$ conda create -n author-name python=3.11 matplotlib pandas numpy networkx seaborn scipy  \n\nChannels:\n - defaults\n - conda-forge\nPlatform: linux-64\nCollecting package metadata (repodata.json): done\nSolving environment: - \nhit y when asked whether to install packages:\nDownloading and Extracting Packages:\n\nPreparing transaction: done                                                                 \nVerifying transaction: done                                                       \nExecuting transaction: done\n#                                                          \n# To activate this environment, use\n#                              \n#     $ conda activate author-name                                                          \n#                                       \n# To deactivate an active environment, use\n#                                                                                        \n#     $ conda deactivate \nAfter it’s done, we can activate that environment.

We need a way to run those inside our environment. So, we also install a notebook runner, while we are in the activated env:\n# install Python kernel in new conda env\n(author-name) 11:42:20 - nuvolos:/files$ conda install ipykernel\n# configure new notebook kernel\n(author-name) 11:42:20 - nuvolos:/files$ ipython kernel install --user --name=author-kernel   \nNow we can select kernel in the notebook view, i.e. we will choose the python engine which goes together with this particular environment.\n\n\n\nSelecting a Kernel from a python environment\n\n\n\n\n\nchoose our created author-name environment\n\n\nClicking on the ▶️ button left of each cell, we can run the contained code.

Notice that python and networkx versions correspond to our specs above.\n\n\n\nThe preceding steps of starting a notebook - from the external drive /space_mounts is illustrated in this video:\n\n\nCreating a conda env via a .yml file\nWe could have equally well created a full recipe file, from which to build this environment. This may be useful to share with authors. You would save that as author-env.yml for instance:\nname: author-name\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.11\n  - matplotlib\n  - seaborn\n  - netwworkx\n  - pandas\n  - numpy\n  - scipy\n  - ipykernel\n  - pip\nThen, one can create the env via\nconda env create -f author-env.yml\n\n\n\nCreating a conda env from a supplie .yml file\nSome authors actually give us such a file!

It will most likely not work on any other MacOS either.\n\nR package installation may use system libraries and tools in order to build the package for your system.

There may be losses along the way which invalidate the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck if files are Identical?\n\n\n\nSuppose you have a 6GB dataset and want to quickly check whether it is identical to the previous version you obtained. You don’t want to check each row of that dataset. Instead, you could compute the md5sum, which is akin to counting bits in the file in a certain kind of way and summing them up. It’s like a digital fingerprint of a file. For example to verify that file_to_check.csv is identical you would do on your linux/Mac terminal\nmd5sum file_to_check.csv\nin both versions of the package, and verify that the result is the same. On your windows powershell you would do this\nCertUtil -hashfile file_to_check.csv MD5\n\n\n\nCompression of files\n\nThere are several compression technologies out there, indicated by various filename endings .zip, .tar, .gz, .7z etc.\n\n\nThere are many different facets to compression which sometimes cause problems.\n\nThe md5 hash of a zip file create on one machine is not necessarily identical to the md5 hash of the zip file created on another machine - despite both having the exact same content. This is because different systems use different algorithms to create the zip file.\nFor zip files larger than 4GB, the macOS default archiver utility often fails with cryptic errors.\na good solution is the p7zip utility.

    "section": "Scope of Reproducibility Checks at EJ",
    "text": "Scope of Reproducibility Checks at EJ\n\nWhat is the exact nature of the reproducibility checks carried out at the Economic Journal?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe purpose of the reproducibility checks carried out at the Economic Journal is to verify three aspects of the replication package: (i) it is complete, in the sense of producing each table, figure, and in-text number in the paper and its appendices, including those online; (ii) it is self-contained, in the sense of not requiring a subprogram or module not included in the package; and (iii) the data and code are adequately documented for other researchers to be able to use them to replicate the results in the paper. When the data are accessible (included in the package or, in case of exemptions, via temporary access by the reproducibility team), the checks ensure that the code exactly reproduces the results in the paper and its appendices. In the case of a data exemption, authors may provide simulated or synthetic data to check that the code runs and produces all output, but the exact results cannot be checked. Reproducibility checks (not replication checks) are conducted. This means that our checks do not screen for coding errors, discrepancies between what the paper claims the code does and what it actually does, econometric errors, or whether the empirical approach followed in the paper can be reproduced in other environments or other datasets.\n\nAre the reproducibility checks implemented on online appendices?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, the replication package should produce each table, figure, and in-text number in the paper and its appendices, including those online. All these codes are checked for their ability to produce the results in the paper and appendices.\n\nWhy is the Economic Journal running reproducibility checks? Why not replication checks?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe firmly believe that reproducibility and replicability are the main pillars of science. The nature of replication checks requires time, effort, and resources that journals typically do not have: the publication process should be speedy for science to advance at the right pace. Our reproducibility checks provide a necessary first step: to ensure that authors publish all available data and the codes that generate the results they present in the papers we publish, and, importantly, to check that these codes and data run and produce the published results. The certification that we provide enhances transparency, since it assures that other researchers can reproduce the published research and test it against other datasets, assumptions, methods, etc. It also provides an additional service to the authors, as we often detect small errors that are better amended before publication than in an erratum afterwards."

    "text": "Data and Code Availability Policy and Exemptions\n\nMy paper uses publicly available data. Is it enough to indicate how to get them or should I provide my datasets as part of the replication package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nEven publicly available data should be included in the replication package to ensure they remain available in the future for anyone who wants to replicate your results. The only exception is when your exact extract is published in a \"trusted\" repository (see the following list for guidance) with a permanent DOI. This is important, because datasets are often updated (or removed) by the provider, and your version of the data may no longer be available to researchers in the future.\n\nMy paper uses publicly available data. Does it imply that I certainly have the right to re-publish my dataset along with the replication package? If not, how can I obtain permission to publish the data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nEach provider offers a different policy regarding re-distribution of original and transformed datasets. Some providers, for example, allow re-distribution as long as your extract is deposited in a specific repository. You should make sure about the restrictions to publish your data before the first submission. You should also make sure to seek permission from the original owner of the data to publish them, and make sure to cite the original source accordingly.\n\nCan I request an exemption to publish my data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, you can request an exemption on the grounds that the data are restricted-access. The request should be made at the time of initial submission, in a cover letter addressed to the Editor. The Editor in charge of your submission will determine whether your request is justified before submitting the paper to referees. If the Editor decides against the exemption, the manuscript will not be sent to referees, and you will be requested to either accept the data and code availability policy or otherwise the paper will be rejected. Submission fees will not be returned in that case. When an exemption is needed for a dataset that is incorporated to the analysis during the editorial process, the exemption should be requested at the first iteration in which the new data are incorporated.\n\nCan I request an exemption that affects only a part of my data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, provided that the request is made at the time of initial submission.\n\nIf my main dataset is available to publish, but there is a small portion of my data that I am not allowed to share, should I request a data exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. If you do not require a data exemption at the time of your first submission, you will be required to publish all the data used in your paper.\n\nIf the only data I am not allowed to share is only used in the online appendix, should I request a data exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. The data to produce all results in the paper and appendices, including those online, should be shared unless an exemption is requested and granted at the time of first submission.\n\nIf the data I use are publicly available to everyone, but I do not have permission to re-publish it, should I request a data exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Unless you are granted an exemption at the time of first submission, you will be required to publish in the replication package all data to produce all results in the paper and appendices, including those online.\n\nCan I request an exemption later than the first initial submission?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn general, no. Later exemptions can only be requested for new data that is incorporated into the analysis during the editorial process. If your data cannot be published and you did not request the exemption at the time of initial submission, your paper may be rejected for publication at Economic Journal.\n\nIf my data are free of charge and available to any researcher who requests it from the data provider, but I don’t have the right to publish it with the replication package, should I request an exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Whenever the data used for the analysis in the paper cannot be published with the replication package (or in an open-access \"trusted\" repository, see the following list for guidance on what constitutes a \"trusted\" repository) an exemption needs to be requested at the time of first submission. Only if the exact extract that was used in the study is published in the repository and it is readily available in the exact format that is called by the code, an exemption will not be requested.\n\nSome data providers only allow authors to distribute the data in specific open repositories (for example, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics only allows to distribute the data using the OpenICPSR Repository). Do I need to request an exemption in such cases?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nNo. Data archived in \"trusted\" open repositories (see the following list for guidance) is acceptable in the replication package provided what is published is the extract that was used in the study and it is readily available in the exact format that is called by your code. The Data Editor will evaluate the suitability of the repository.\n\nIf I published my data in an open repository, do I need to include it in the replication package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nData archived in \"trusted\" open repositories (see the following list for guidance) is acceptable in the replication package provided what is published is the extract that was used in the study and it is readily available in the exact format that is called by the code. The Data Editor will evaluate the suitability of the repository and whether or not there is the need of publishing a copy with the package on the journal’s repository.\n\nIf I publish my replication package on my website (or similar), do I need to submit a replication package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Personal websites are not considered \"trusted\" open repositories, because there is no guarantee that the package will be systematically archived. See the following list for guidance on what constitutes a \"trusted\" repository.\n\nCan I request an exemption to publish my data because I collected these data and I want to keep exclusivity rights for future research?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nNo. The goal of our data and code availability policy is to ensure transparency and reproducibility of research, and this requires publishing the data you collected. If others can use your data, your research will gain visibility.\n\nCan I apply for data exemption if my data come from a commercial data provider (Datastream, Orbis, …)?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Restricted access data is generally discouraged, but when the nature of your research largely relies on a specific dataset and cannot be conducted on an open alternative, those data are eligible for an exemption. However, you may be requested to provide a certification from the provider indicating that the data will be archived and made available to other users following the same procedure to request access to it.\n\nCan I request an exemption for the experimental data I collected?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn general, no. Data should be anonymized to ensure that subjects cannot be identified. Only when the nature of the study impedes such anonymization, the authors can request a data exemption, which will cover only the required minimum to ensure the anonymity of the experimental subjects.\n\nCan I request an exemption to publish my code?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nNo.\n\nCan I use any software, proprietary and open source?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Open source software is encouraged, but licensed software is allowed. If the authors use software which is rather uncommon and requires special licenses, we ask for their cooperation to find a solution (which might entail providing remote access to the authors’ machine to our replicators in extreme cases.).\n\nDo I need to publish packages and libraries that are used by my code but not part of the standard distribution of the software used?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWhenever possible, yes. If these packages or libraries are available in open repositories (e.g. most Stata packages), a clear indication on how to download and use them is sufficient. If the libraries cannot be included in the packages and are not publicly available, the Data Editor will be in contact with the authors to coordinate on a feasible way to implement the checks."

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "Procedures when Exemptions Are Granted",
    "text": "Procedures when Exemptions Are Granted\n\nIf I was granted a data exemption, how should I proceed with the replication package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIf you were granted a data exemption, your paper would still need to go through reproducibility checks before final acceptance. In order to do so, you can either (i) grant temporary (distance or physical) access to the data to the reproducibility team for the sole purpose of the checks (the data will be destroyed or access terminated after the checks), or (ii) supply simulated or synthetic dataset(s) instead of the one(s) used in the analysis.\n\nWhat is the difference between simulated data and synthetic data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nA simulated dataset is generated by a model (ideally, your model). A synthetic dataset is a scrambling or perturbation of the actual dataset to ensure anonymity.\n\nIs it better to provide temporary access to the restricted data or to provide a simulated/synthetic dataset?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWhenever feasible, we strongly recommend providing temporary access to restricted data. There are numerous advantages of this approach: (i) it saves the effort of producing synthetic or simulated datasets; (ii) the certification provided by the journal is stronger in the sense that we certify that we have been able to reproduce the results published in the paper as opposed to only checking that the code is complete, runs, and produces output for all tables, figures, and in-text numbers published in the article and its printed and online appendices; (iii) we can detect if the results cannot be reproduced, which gives the authors a chance to fix any errors before publication.\n\nWhat is the procedure followed by the Economic Journal when I supply restricted datasets for the sole purpose of the reproducibility checks?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe reproducibility team will treat the data with the highest ethical standards, preventing any violations of confidentiality, and using them exclusively to run the reproducibility checks. The restricted datasets will be destroyed as soon as the checks are performed and, therefore, they will not be published.\n\nWhat shall I do if I am not allowed to provide temporary access to the confidential data, but the data provider can run the code to implement the reproducibility checks?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nEven if you cannot provide direct access to the reproducibility team, this option is preferred to the simulated/synthetic dataset alternative as long as the checks can be executed in a reasonable amount of time. In this case, you need to supply the replication package to the journal and the contact of the data provider. The reproducibility team will send the code to the provider and the provider will send the output back to the team, who will check the results.\n\nWhat can I do if I am not allowed to provide temporary access to the confidential data, but a certification agency (e.g. cascad) can run the code in the original data source?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThis option is still generally preferred to the simulated/synthetic dataset alternative. However, you should seek approval by the Data Editor before making any commitments with the certification agency. The Economic Journal, however, will NOT be able to cover the cost of certification.\n\nIf my restricted-access data provider has a public use testing sample (smaller sample, or perturbed dataset), can I provide this sample instead of a simulated/ synthetic dataset?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIf this option is available, it is generally preferred to the simulated/synthetic dataset (but less preferred to providing temporary access to the original data) as long as the testing sample can be published with your package. Otherwise, a simulated/synthetic dataset that can be published with the package is preferred.\n\nWhat is the procedure followed by the Economic Journal if I supply simulated/synthetic datasets?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe simulated/synthetic dataset will be published with the replication package. Even if these are not the real data, their structure, which by design will largely mimic the actual dataset, will give readers a better sense of your data. Please make sure the manipulations used to produce the synthetic/simulated datasets are described in the ReadMe file.\n\nWhy am I requested to supply a simulated/synthetic data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nOur view is that, when reproducibility checks cannot be performed on real data, there is still an advantage of running them on such simulated/synthetic datasets: they are still useful to make sure the code is complete and self-contained, and that it runs without errors.\n\nMy article estimates a non-linear model. The algorithm does not converge with randomly generated data. What shall I do?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn this case, we strongly recommend simulating data using your model as data generating process. If that is not feasible, please contact the Data Editor explaining in detail why this is the case. The Data Editor will either assist you in the process, and, eventually, s/he will make a proposal to your original Editor about how to handle the situation.\n\nHow do I decide whether to produce a simulated or a synthetic dataset?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn order to generate a dataset that mimics the same characteristics as the original one, the synthetic option may be easier. There are many open source routines that do it for you. However, there are also two main disadvantages: (i) you need to make sure that your scrambling/perturbation algorithm ensures correct anonymization of the data; and (ii) non-linear estimation routines may not converge on synthetic data, whereas they are more likely to converge in an artificial dataset generated by the model that you are estimating.\n\nHow should I produce a synthetic dataset?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThere are multiple ways to generate it. You can find some useful links with helpful resources, mostly in R, here, here, here, and here"

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "Implementation of the Reproducibility Checks",
    "text": "Implementation of the Reproducibility Checks\n\nHow long do the reproducibility checks take?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe usually provide the outcome of our reproducibility checks in less than two weeks. If the package is not complete or the code does not run, more than one iteration may be required, in which case the processing time might be increased. Articles that require a relatively long running time may take longer. The processing time also depends on how responsive the authors are to our requests.\n\nHow do the reproducibility checks work?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe reproducibility checks are handled by our Data Editor and our reproducibility team: a team of advanced Ph.D. students that have been hired to carry out the checks under the supervision of the Data Editor. Once an article is conditionally accepted for publication at the Economic Journal, the authors are requested to submit the replication package along with other production files. Upon submission, the Data Editor assigns the package to one or several members of the reproducibility team. The reproducibility team provides the Data Editor with a report summarizing the outcome of the checks. After reviewing it, the Data Editor contacts the authors informing them about the outcome of the replication checks, and eventually requests them to amend the package if needed. Once the replication checks are completed, the article is transferred back to the original Editor, who is in charge of final acceptance. If results in the paper need to be modified as a result of the checks, the original Editor in charge will be responsible for approving these changes before acceptance. If these changes imply a modification of the message of the paper, the original Editor can decide to reject the paper. Final acceptance is conditional on full reproducibility.\n\nWill the Economic Journal run my code?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Upon submission, the Data Editor assigns the package to one or several members of the reproducibility team, who will run your code and check the output generated. The reproducibility team provides the Data Editor with a report summarizing the outcome of the checks. In some instances, the code is too demanding to be run in a reasonable amount of time. In such cases, the Data Editor will be in contact with you with a recommendation for supplying a simplified version of the code that allows testing the essential parts of the code.\n\nWhat happens if my code is highly demanding computationally?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIf the code is too demanding to be run in a reasonable amount of time, the Data Editor will be in contact with you with a recommendation for supplying a simplified version of the code that allows testing the essential parts of the code. For example, this can entail a reduced number of replications of a simulation exercise, the code that solves a structural model for a given set of parameters, a simplified function to test an optimization routine, etc. Such a simplified \"testing\" version will be published along with the original code in your replication package. This is so because we believe that these testing versions are extremely useful for other researchers that want to understand and use your code for replication or their related research, enhancing transparency and increasing the visibility of your research.\n\nWhat happens if the results fail to reproduce?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIf the data and code that you provided fail to replicate the results in the paper, the Data Editor will be in contact with you to identify the source of the discrepancy. Once the reproducibility checks are completed, if the discrepancy implies a change in the results presented in the paper or online appendices, even if minor, the Data Editor will notify it to the original Editor in charge. The Editor in charge will be responsible for approving these changes before acceptance. If these changes imply a modification of the message of the paper, the original Editor can decide to reject the paper. Final acceptance is conditional on full reproducibility.\n\nWhat happens if the replication package I provided is not complete?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe Data Editor will be in contact with you indicating the amendments and additions that need to be done to the replication package to pass the reproducibility checks. Once amended, the revised package will go through the checks again.\n\nWhat happens if the file I provided is not complete?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe Data Editor will be in contact with you indicating the amendments and additions that need to be done to the replication package to pass the reproducibility checks. Once amended, the revised package will go through the checks again.\n\nWhy do I need to resubmit the entire package (instead of only the revised part of it) when I incorporate the feedback received from the Data Editor and the reproducibility team?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe need you to submit the entire package again because updating the replication package ourselves increases the potential risk that the files you intend to submit for possible publication may be mishandled."

    "text": "Content of the Replication Package\n\nWhat should be included in the replication package? Please see here.\nHow do I provide physical access to the replication team to my restricted-access data when I have been granted a data exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWhenever possible, the easiest way is to provide a physical copy of your data by including it in a separate folder labeled \"4 Confidential data not for publication\" outside of the replication package. All replicators and the Data Editor have signed confidentiality agreements that prevent them to use the data for any other purpose than the reproducibility checks. When that option is not feasible, we recommend you to contact our Data Editor to arrange the best way to provide access to the reproducibility team.\n\nWhy do I need to submit a signed checklist?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nTo ensure that you do not forget all elements of the replication package. This avoids repeated iterations and speeds up the process.\n\nShould I respect the folder structure dictated by the checklist, or is it only for orientation?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, you should and it is very important to do so. When submitted to production, your package is handled by different people at the Economic Journal and at the publisher, not all of them familiarized with data and code. Respecting the folder structure ensures that your package is published correctly.\n\nWhat information should be included in the ReadMe file? Please see here.\nShould I submit the raw data files and the code that generates my final dataset from them?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, this is requested by our Data and Code Availability Policy.\n\nWhy do I need to supply all text documents (ReadMe, IRB, etc.) in PDF format?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe PDF format is portable, which means that it can be transferred without having to worry about dependencies, fonts, etc. This ensures readability across platforms and users.\n\nWhy do I need to include a copy of all datasets in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv, etc.)?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nSome users of your replication package may be not have access to the specific proprietary software that you used for your study. This ensures that they can have access to your data without problems. It also minimizes compatibility issues (e.g., old versions of Stata cannot open files saved by newer versions)."

    "section": "Reproducibility Certification, Publication of the Replication Package and Copyright Issues",
    "text": "Reproducibility Certification, Publication of the Replication Package and Copyright Issues\n\nWhat kind of certification do we provide for papers that were checked for reproducibility?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe empirical/simulation/experimental papers that we checked include the following statement: \"The data and codes for this paper are available at […]. They were checked for their ability to reproduce the results presented in the paper.\" This statement is adjusted accordingly when data exemptions are granted (acknowledging either that the authors provided temporary access to the confidential data or that the checks were implemented on simulated/synthetic data provided by the authors). In particular, we either certify \"The authors were granted an exemption to publish their data because access to the data is restricted. However, the authors provided a simulated or synthetic dataset that allowed the Journal to run their codes. The synthetic/simulated data and codes are available at […]. They were checked for their ability to generate all tables and figures in the paper, however, the synthetic/simulated data are not designed to reproduce the same results.\" or \"The authors were granted an exemption to publish their data because access to the data is restricted. However, the authors provided the Journal with temporary access to the data, which allowed the Journal to run their codes. The codes are available at […]. The data and codes were checked for their ability to reproduce the results presented in the paper.\", depending on the case that is applicable. These statements are combined accordingly when more than one situation applies. The statements are also also adjusted when the nature of the algorithms is highly demanding, and a partial/simplified version of the code has been used for the reproducibility checks: we add the sentence \"Given the highly demanding nature of the algorithms, the replication checks were run on a simplified version of the code, which is also available at […]\" to the applicable statement.\n\nWhere will the replication package be published?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nAfter all reproducibility checks are completed, you will be requested by the Editorial Office to publish your checked package at the Economic Journal’s community of Zenodo. Zenodo will assing your package a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which then will be linked with your publication.\n\nDo I keep the copyright of my package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, one of the main advantages of you publishing the package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo is that you are the sole responsible and copyright owner of the specific publication. Therefore, it is important that you ensure that you have permission to publish your data before the time of first submission and request an exemption then if you don’t.\n\nWhy are packages published at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo instead of with the article on the Journal’s website?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThere are many advantages from publishing the package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo. Some of them are: (i) the author retains the copyright on the replication package, (ii) by having a specific DOI, it increases the visibility of all packages and, in turn, it increases the visibility of your article, and (iii) it makes it easier to cite.\n\nCan I post my replication material on other sites?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, as long as one copy is published at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo. The only exception is when your replication package is published in a \"trusted\" repository (see the following list for guidance) with a permanent DOI. In that case, your DOI can be used to link your article with your package, and the Data Editor can wave the requirement to publish the package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo. However, publishing your package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo is recommended, because it increases the visibility of your package.\n\nAll data is publicly available. Do I still need to get permission from the website owner to post data on Economic Journal’s publisher website?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nEach provider offers a different policy regarding re-distribution of original and transformed datasets. Some providers, for example, allow re-distribution as long as your extract is deposited in a specific repository. You should make sure about the restrictions to publish your data before the first submission. You should also make sure to seek permission from the original owner of the data to publish them, and make sure to cite the original source accordingly. You will be the responsible of copyright infringements for what you publish with the replication package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo.\n\nCan I retrospectively include a replication package as supplementary online material to my Economic Journal article?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Please address your request to the Editorial Office at ej@res.org.uk"
